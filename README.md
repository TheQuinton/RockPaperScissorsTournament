RockPaperScissorsTournament
===========================

A rock paper scissors tournament written in OO java

This was the Final project for my object oriented programming course.
The program simulates a tournament of rock paper scissors. Any number of players can be used for the game.
The game determines whether a player will recieve a by or not based on the remaining number of players in the tournament.
A player object is used to record the stats of players in the game, and saves these stats to a file named after the player.
When the program is run again, if a player is created with the same name as an existing save file, the file will be loaded.
Otherwise a new file will be created. 

This program demonstrates using multiple classes and having them interact with eachother.
